    "The goal of this project is to create an optimal subplaylist of a bigger playlist, maximizing some metrics related to how good the tracks are, subject to maximum duration and possibly other constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the Spotify Playlist [For Those About to Rock](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5TUxgTIxzLbLVh7RUf9V8i?si=9c057405f51747b8) created by [Rafaella Bellerini](https://github.com/rafaballerini) with more than a thousand rock songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data was colected through Spotify API, which provides the following metrics for each track (descriptions from [API documentation]((https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-features))):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Track Popularity:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The value will be between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Artist Popularity:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The artist's popularity is calculated from the popularity of all the artist's tracks, and also ranges from 0 to 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Duration:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The track length (in minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Danceability:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0 is least danceable and 1 is most danceable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Energy:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A measure from 0 to 1 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Acousticness:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A confidence measure from 0 to 1 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instrumentalness:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly \"vocal\". The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content\n",
    "\n",
    "- Liveness:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Valence:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A measure from 0 to 1 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)."
